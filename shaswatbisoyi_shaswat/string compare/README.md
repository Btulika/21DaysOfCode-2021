Question: Using strcmp() check wheter the strings are same or not.

Solution: While using strcmp(), it compares the strings character by character until a mismatch and returns the difference of the ASCII values of the first mismatched character, otherwise the comaprision keeps on going and if the strings are equal the comparison goes till the end of the string and returns zero i.e the strings are equal.
