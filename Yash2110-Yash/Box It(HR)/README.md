Solution:
</br>
 In this hackerrank problem we design a class with the following member functions using different concepts like different types of constructors, operator overloading, use of friend function.
 </br>
                - We make three different types of constructors: default,paramterized,copy.
                </br>
                - We make member functions to take values into data members.
                </br>
                -We use operator overloading to overload < and << operator for the given class.
                </br>
                -We use the concept of friend function to access private data members
